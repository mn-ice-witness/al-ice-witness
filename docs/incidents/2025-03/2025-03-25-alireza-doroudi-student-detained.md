# University of Alabama Doctoral Student Detained by ICE, Self-Deports After 45 Days

## Summary
Alireza Doroudi, an Iranian doctoral student in mechanical engineering at the University of Alabama, was detained by ICE at his home at 5 a.m. on March 25, 2025. DHS claimed he posed "significant national security concerns," but no evidence was ever presented to justify this claim. After 45 days in detention, Doroudi chose voluntary departure to Iran rather than face prolonged detention. His attorneys noted that DHS acknowledged during his hearing that the initial visa revocation charge was an error.

## Official Accounts

### DHS/ICE Statement
A DHS spokesperson stated: "ICE HSI made this arrest in accordance with the State Department's revocation of Doroudi's student visa. This individual posed significant national security concerns."

DHS did not provide information about why it determined Doroudi posed a national security threat.

### Attorney's Response
Attorney David Rozas disputed the claims:

> "He is legally present in the U.S., pursuing his American dream by working towards his doctorate in mechanical engineering."

Rozas noted Doroudi was "not involved, nor has he ever been involved in any anti-government protests."

Following the May 8 hearing, Doroudi's legal team stated:

> "No evidence was ever presented in the record to justify the initial claims of national security concerns. The only charges brought against Mr. Doroudi were the revocation of his F-1 student visa and an allegation of 'not being in status.'"

> "The Department of Homeland Security acknowledged this and indicated during the master hearing their intention to drop the charge."

### University of Alabama
The university stated: "Federal privacy laws limit what can be shared about an individual student."

## Community Response
Over 150 people gathered outside the Richard Shelby Federal Building in downtown Birmingham to demand Doroudi's release. UA College Democrats organized the protest.

Students for Justice in Palestine at UA stated that Doroudi "was not involved, nor has he ever been involved in any organizing or protests related to our organization."

## Outcome
After 45 days in detention, Doroudi chose voluntary departure to Iran. His attorneys noted:

> "He turned and looked at me and said 'I love this country, but they don't want me here so I will go home.'"

## Editorial Assessment

DHS acknowledged during the hearing that the visa revocation charge should be dropped, effectively admitting the initial arrest was in error. Core facts consistent across all sources.
