# Lawsuit Filed Over ICE Courthouse Tactic: Dismiss Cases, Then Arrest Outside

## Summary
In August 2025, advocates filed a lawsuit on behalf of a dozen immigrants who were unexpectedly arrested after having their immigration court cases dismissed. A new ICE tactic had emerged where immigrants' cases were dismissed in immigration court with no reason given, and they were then arrested outside the courthouse. The practice created fear about attending court dates, as missing court results in in absentia removal orders.

## Affected Individual(s)
- **Lawsuit plaintiffs:** 12 immigrants arrested using this tactic

## The Tactic
1. Immigrant appears for scheduled immigration court hearing
2. Case is unexpectedly dismissed without explanation
3. ICE agents wait outside the courthouse
4. Individual is arrested immediately upon leaving

## Impact
The tactic created a catch-22 for immigrants:
- Attending court risked arrest outside the courthouse
- Missing court resulted in automatic in absentia removal orders
- Neither option provided meaningful opportunity to present legal defense

## Legal Challenge
Advocates argued the practice violated due process rights and constituted entrapment, using the court system to facilitate arrests rather than adjudicate cases on their merits.

## Editorial Assessment
**HIGH** - Documented by Alabama Reflector with specific details about the lawsuit. The pattern was confirmed across multiple cases, leading to organized legal action.
