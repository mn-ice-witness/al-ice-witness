# HICA Volunteer and Youth Advocate Detained After Leeds Traffic Stop, Later Deported

## Summary
In early August 2025, Giovanna Hernandez Martinez, a volunteer for the Hispanic Interest Coalition of Alabama (HICA), was detained after a traffic stop in Leeds. Leeds Police contacted ICE and had her taken into custody. She was transferred to Pickens County Jail, then to ICE custody. A bilingual education advocate and social worker, she operated Juntos Coaching and Consulting, working with youth. After weeks in custody (reportedly lacking adequate healthcare access), Martinez was deported to Mexico - a country she hadn't been in since age 7.

## Affected Individual(s)
- **Giovanna Hernandez Martinez:** HICA volunteer, social worker, youth advocate
- Operated Juntos Coaching and Consulting
- In the U.S. since age 7
- Deported to Mexico

## Agencies Involved
- Leeds Police Department
- Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)
- Pickens County Jail

## Community Response
HICA CEO Carlos E. Aleman called her "a role model" whose detention is "a painful loss for the entire community." Supporters organized rallies calling for her release. Civil rights groups later filed public information requests regarding ICE agreements with Leeds Police, questioning the extent of local-federal cooperation in immigration enforcement.

## Context
The case highlighted concerns about local police departments' role in immigration enforcement and the impact on community members who have lived in the U.S. for decades. Martinez's deportation to a country she left as a young child raised questions about the human cost of enforcement policies.

## Editorial Assessment
**HIGH** - Documented by Alabama Reflector with statements from HICA leadership. The specific details of her community work and length of time in the U.S. were confirmed by multiple sources.
