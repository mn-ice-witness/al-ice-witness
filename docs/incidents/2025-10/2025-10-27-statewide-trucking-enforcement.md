# 82 Truck Drivers Detained in Statewide ICE-ALEA Enforcement Operations

## Summary
Between October 27 and November 18, 2025, the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency (ALEA) and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detained 82 truck drivers during commercial motor vehicle inspections on Alabama's rural interstate corridors. The operations were conducted in two "Strike Force" phases targeting trucking industry workers. Governor Kay Ivey praised the partnership, while industry groups supported the crackdown on what they called "illegal operators."

## Affected Individual(s)
- **Number detained:** 82
- **Total referred to ICE:** 242 individuals encountered during CMV inspections
- **License status:** 12 had no driver's license of any kind; 70 held out-of-state licenses

## Timeline

### First Strike Force Operation
- **October 27-30, 2025** - ALEA Motor Carrier Safety Unit conducts targeted enforcement on rural interstate corridors

### Second Strike Force Operation
- **November 16-18, 2025** - Second round of targeted enforcement operations

### Results Announced
- **December 4, 2025** - Governor Ivey and ALEA announce results of the partnership

## Enforcement Details
ALEA's Motor Carrier Safety Unit focused on high-crash rural interstate corridors where commercial vehicle traffic is heavy and safety risks are elevated. During commercial motor vehicle (CMV) inspections, 242 individuals were referred to ICE for immigration status checks. Of those, 82 were detained based on their immigration status.

## Official Accounts

### Governor Kay Ivey
> "Alabama is leading the way when it comes to going after illegal bad actors in trucking. I'm proud of ALEA for taking decisive action and grateful for our strong partnership with ICE. Alabama will not look the other way while illegal immigration and illegal operators threaten the safety of our communities or undermine the integrity of our trucking industry."

### Alabama Trucking Association President Mark Colson
> "Alabama's trucking industry is built on the hard work of family-owned small businesses and professional drivers who follow the rules and operate safely, but a growing number of illegal operators and bad actors who exploit regulatory loophole are compromising safety and undercutting hard working Alabamians who move our economy."

## Context
The Alabama operations were part of a broader federal crackdown on immigrant truck drivers. Similar operations in Wyoming, Oklahoma, Indiana, and Texas resulted in additional detentions.

The enforcement effort aligned with Trump administration policies targeting the trucking industry, including Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy's order requiring English language proficiency for drivers and announcements to revoke certification of driving schools not meeting training requirements.

## Editorial Assessment
**HIGH** - Official announcement from Governor's office, extensive coverage by trade publications (Land Line Media, Overdrive, Commercial Carrier Journal, Transport Topics), and local news outlets. ALEA provided specific statistics. Core facts consistent across all sources.
