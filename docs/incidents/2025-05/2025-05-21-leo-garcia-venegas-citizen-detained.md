# U.S. Citizen Detained Twice at Alabama Construction Sites, Files Federal Lawsuit

## Summary
Leonardo Garcia Venegas, a U.S. citizen born in Florida, was detained by ICE agents twice—on May 21 and June 12, 2025—during warrantless raids on private construction sites in Baldwin County, Alabama. Despite presenting his REAL ID both times, agents refused to release him immediately. He has filed a federal civil rights lawsuit challenging the raids as unconstitutional racial profiling.

## Official Accounts

### DHS/ICE Statement
DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin called the lawsuit "baseless" and "race-baiting opportunism":

> "Allegations that DHS law enforcement officers engage in 'racial profiling' are disgusting, reckless, and categorically FALSE."

DHS claimed Garcia Venegas was detained because he "physically got in between agents and the subject [ICE] were attempting to arrest and refused to comply with numerous verbal commands."

> "Anyone who actively obstructs law enforcement in the performance of their sworn duties, including U.S. citizens, will of course face consequences which include arrest."

### Plaintiff's Response
Garcia Venegas's attorney disputed the DHS statement, pointing to video evidence showing Garcia Venegas was recording several yards away from where law enforcement was attempting to detain someone. The video "shows Mr. Garcia being kind of violently tackled to the ground and then led away."

## Legal Action
The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Alabama by the Institute for Justice, challenges:
- Warrantless raids on private construction sites
- Detention of workers without reasonable suspicion
- Continued detention after presentation of citizenship evidence
- Racial profiling of Latino workers

The lawsuit seeks to stop "dragnet raids" that target Latinos without probable cause.

## Context
The Gulf of America Homeland Security Task Force has been conducting aggressive raids on Alabama construction sites since early 2025. Federal agents—often masked and armed—have raided private construction sites without warrants. One news station reported that "federal agencies have raided multiple construction sites across the [Mobile] bay" and raids had been happening "for months."

## Editorial Assessment
**HIGH** - Federal lawsuit filed by Institute for Justice, extensive coverage by PBS, ABC News, Reason, and Alabama Reflector. Affected individual named and documented. Video evidence exists from the first detention. Core facts are consistent across sources. DHS's "obstruction" defense is disputed by video evidence and attorney statement.
