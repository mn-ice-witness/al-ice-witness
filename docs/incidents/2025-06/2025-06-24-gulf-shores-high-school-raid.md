## Official Accounts

### FBI Statement
FBI Special Agent PJ Lavoie confirmed:

> "The operation was coordinated after receiving multiple tips from members of the community about illegal immigrants being employed at the site."

Lavoie noted the construction boom driving enforcement:

> "Baldwin County is one of the fastest-growing counties in the country. So, there is a large amount of construction."

### Contractor Response
Rabren General Contractors president Matt Rabren publicly acknowledged the situation:

> "We're sorry, we're embarrassed, and we will get it cleaned up."

He emphasized their commitment to cooperating with authorities and improving oversight of subcontractors.

## Context
This raid was among a growing number of construction site enforcement actions since May 2025. More than 200 combined arrests had been made since May 15 in ICE raids on construction sites across Florida, Texas, Louisiana, Massachusetts, and Vermont.

The Gulf Shores High School, a $137 million public facility funded by taxpayers, was expected to open the following year. This was the first time federal agents made arrests at a facility funded by taxpayers in the area.

## Industry Impact
The Alabama construction industry has reported significant workforce shortages following the immigration enforcement surge. Multiple news outlets documented the struggle to find workers willing to fill positions previously held by those arrested.

## Editorial Assessment
**HIGH** - Extensively documented by multiple local news outlets including FOX 10, WKRG, and Alabama Gazette. FBI provided official statement with specific statistics on criminal histories. Contractor president made public statement. Video evidence captured the raid. Core facts consistent across all sources.
