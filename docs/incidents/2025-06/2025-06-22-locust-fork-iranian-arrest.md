# ICE Arrests Iranian National with Military ID Card in Blount County

## Summary
On June 22, 2025, ICE Atlanta arrested Ribvar Karimi in Locust Fork, Blount County. Karimi reportedly served as an Iranian Army sniper from 2018-2021. At the time of arrest, he possessed an Islamic Republic of Iran Army identification card. He had entered the U.S. on a K-1 fiancee visa in October 2024 and married his American fiancee in January 2025 but never adjusted his immigration status. His arrest was part of a nationwide operation that detained 11 Iranian nationals that weekend.

## Affected Individual(s)
- **Ribvar Karimi:** Iranian national, former military service 2018-2021
- Part of 11 Iranian nationals arrested nationally that weekend

## Family Statement
Karimi's wife (seven months pregnant at time of arrest) defended him, stating that he fought ISIS during his military service and was captured at one point. She emphasized he never fought against America and questioned why his legal K-1 visa status was not being considered.

## Context
The arrest was highlighted by federal officials as part of national security enforcement targeting foreign nationals with military backgrounds. The case drew attention to the complex situations of individuals who enter legally on fiancee visas but face enforcement for status violations.

## Editorial Assessment
**HIGH** - Official DHS press release confirming arrest. Local news coverage includes statements from both federal officials and family members. The unique circumstances (K-1 visa holder, pregnant wife, Iranian military background) made this a high-profile case.
