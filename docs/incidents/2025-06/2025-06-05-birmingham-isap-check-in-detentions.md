# Dozens Detained at Birmingham ISAP Check-In Appointments

## Summary
On June 5, 2025, ICE detained dozens of immigrants who arrived for routine check-in appointments at the Intensive Supervision Appearance Program (ISAP) office on Birmingham's Southside. Reports indicated approximately 50 people were detained in Birmingham and 18 in Gadsden. Many had been complying with immigration requirements for years. Advocates called the detentions a betrayal of trust, noting that those detained were "low-hanging fruit" who showed up believing they were following the law.

## Official Accounts

### ICE Statement
> "Those arrested had executable final orders of removal by an immigration judge and had not complied with that order. If you are in the country illegally and a judge has ordered you to be removed, that is precisely what will happen."

### Senator Tommy Tuberville (R-AL)
Senator Tuberville confirmed the operations:

> "If you're here undocumented, you do need to check in your local office. If you don't, you're breaking the law by not showing up."

## Witness Accounts

### Family Member - Adriana
Adriana, whose mother was detained after eight years of compliance, expressed her devastation:

> "For them to just take away my mom without her having, you know, to do anything. And she's still reported herself here expecting the best; the best outcome didn't happen."

### Lisa Moyer, Bham Migra Watch
> "Those folks are low-hanging fruit for detention because they're already sort of in the system. And so, it's not right. And those people are trying to do the right thing."

### Allison Hamilton, Alabama Coalition for Immigrant Justice
> "The people who are trying to comply with the ever changing laws...are the ones being targeted and punished."

> "The message right now that these kinds of activities send is that there is no right way to be an immigrant in this country. The message is very clear that immigrants are not welcome or wanted in this country."

## Context
The ISAP (Intensive Supervision Appearance Program) office in Birmingham's Southside is where immigrants can register and participate in the program, which serves as an alternative to detention for people waiting for their immigration cases to be heard. Historically, immigrants enrolled in ISAP are allowed to remain in the community while their proceedings are ongoing, often wearing ankle monitors as part of their reporting requirements.

Advocates noted that people received notices claiming the system was down and their documentation was lost before being detained.

## Editorial Assessment
**HIGH** - Documented by WBRC FOX6, WVTM 13, The Birmingham Times, and Here Birmingham. Senator Tuberville and ICE provided official statements confirming the operations. Named advocacy organization representatives provided detailed accounts. Family member Adriana provided firsthand testimony. Core facts consistent across sources.
