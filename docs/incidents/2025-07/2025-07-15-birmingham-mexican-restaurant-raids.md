# 48 Detained in Coordinated ICE Raids on Mexican Restaurants Across Alabama

## Summary
On July 15, 2025, federal agents conducted simultaneous raids on eight Mexican restaurants across Alabama, detaining 48 people. While officials claimed the operation was part of a fraud investigation, only three people were placed in federal custody on criminal charges. Advocacy groups called the operation a "false flag" designed to meet deportation quotas, noting the massive resources deployed yielded minimal criminal evidence.

- Gulf of America Homeland Security Task Force

## Official Accounts

### Federal Position
Federal officials described the operation as a years-long investigation into business ownership and operations, focusing on PPP loan fraud and other financial crimes.

### Bham Migra Watch Statement
Birmingham Migra Watch, a project of the Alabama Coalition for Immigrant Justice, called the operation a "false flag":

> "This terror operation involved hundreds of agents, millions of tax dollars, years of planning, and 14 simultaneous raids—only to find $100,000 in restaurant money, a few drugs, and a few guns at a single location. The 'Gulf of America Homeland Security Task Force' agents couldn't even locate the one person they were supposedly looking for."

## Community Impact
Immigration attorneys in Birmingham urged community members to know their rights following the raids. The disproportionate number of ICE detentions (48) compared to actual criminal arrests (3) raised questions about whether immigration enforcement was the primary goal rather than the stated fraud investigation.

## Editorial Assessment
**HIGH** - Extensively documented by Alabama Political Reporter, WBRC, WSFA, and multiple local news outlets. Federal charges filed and documented. Official statements from both federal authorities and advocacy groups. Core facts consistent across sources. The disparity between 48 ICE detentions and 3 criminal arrests is documented by multiple outlets.
