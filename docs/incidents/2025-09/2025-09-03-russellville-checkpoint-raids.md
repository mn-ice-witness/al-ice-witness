## Official Accounts

### Governor Kay Ivey Statement
Governor Ivey celebrated the operation:

> "I previously directed the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency and our other public safety cabinet agencies to work closely with ICE to catch criminal illegals, and this bust is one example of the fruits of our labor."

### Franklin County Sheriff
Sheriff Shannon Oliver confirmed the agents were from ICE and ATF, with Alabama Law Enforcement Agency officers also involved.

### ALEA Confirmation
The Alabama Law Enforcement Agency confirmed troopers conducted drivers' license checkpoints in Franklin and Colbert counties where ICE special agents were present.

## Community Context
More than one-third of Russellville area residents identify as Hispanic, according to census figures—far exceeding the statewide proportion of 6%. The area's large immigrant workforce is centered around the poultry processing industry.

## Community Response
The Alabama Coalition for Immigrant Justice urged people to call their hotline with any information or requests for legal help following the arrests. The group operates the Bham Migra Watch program to alert communities about ICE activity.

On February 8, 2025 (prior to this raid), more than 100 people demonstrated in front of the Franklin County Courthouse to protest immigration policies. The event included chants of "No human's illegal." Many said they knew others who wanted to attend but were afraid to do so out of fear of deportation.

## Context
This operation was described as one of the first state-federal checkpoint operations of its kind in Alabama. ICE's enforcement strategy targeted workers during shift changes at major employers, effectively using employment patterns to identify and intercept workers.
