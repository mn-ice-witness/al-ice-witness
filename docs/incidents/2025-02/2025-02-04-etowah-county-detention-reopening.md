# Notorious Etowah County Detention Center to Reopen for ICE Detainees

## Summary
In February 2025, Sheriff Jonathan Horton announced at the National Sheriffs' Association conference that the Etowah County Jail in Gadsden would resume detaining ICE detainees. The facility had closed its ICE contract in March 2022 amid documented abuse and deficiencies. With 865+ bed capacity, it was being prepared for renewed immigration detention. Negotiations had been ongoing since December 2024/January 2025.

## Background
The Etowah County Detention Center was the subject of extensive criticism before its ICE contract was terminated in 2022. Documented issues included:
- Inadequate medical care
- Excessive use of solitary confinement
- Poor conditions
- Civil rights violations

## Context
As of February 27, 2025, more than 43,700 people were in ICE custody nationwide - the highest level since 2019. The reopening of closed detention facilities reflects the administration's push to expand detention capacity.

## Community Response
Immigrant rights organizations condemned the reopening, citing the facility's troubled history. The Detention Watch Network and other advocacy groups called for accountability and independent monitoring.

## Editorial Assessment
**HIGH** - Official announcements documented by WBRC and Detention Watch Network. Historical context about facility's previous closure well-documented. Represents significant infrastructure expansion for immigration enforcement in Alabama.
